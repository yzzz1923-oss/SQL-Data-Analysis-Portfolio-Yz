-- analysis and finding
--1)Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-12-02':
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-12-02';
--2)Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions order by date where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 3 in the month of Oct-2022:
SELECT * from retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Clothing' AND quantity >= 3 AND TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') = '2022-10'
ORDER BY sale_date;
--3)Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale)and total order (total_order) for each category.:
SELECT category, SUM(total_sale),COUNT(*) as total_order from retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
--4)Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Electronics' category.:
SELECT ROUND(AVG(age), 0)as average_age from retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Electronics';
--5)Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.:
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale >= 1000;
--6)Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.:
SELECT category,gender,COUNT(transactions_id) AS num_of_tid FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category, gender
ORDER BY category;
--7)Write a SQL query to calculate the total sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year:
SELECT year,month,total_sale FROM(	
	SELECT 
		EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) as year,
		EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) as month,
		SUM(total_sale) as total_sale, 
		RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY SUM(total_sale) DESC) AS rank 
	FROM retail_sales
	GROUP BY year,month) as t1
WHERE rank = 1; 

--8)**Write a SQL query to find the top 10 customers based on the highest total sales **:
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sale FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_sale DESC
LIMIT 10;
--9)Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.:
SELECT category, COUNT(DISTINCT (customer_id)) AS num_of_customer FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;

--10)Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17):
WITH hourly_sale AS
(
    SELECT *,
        CASE
            WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
            WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
            ELSE 'Evening'
        END as shift 
    FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT 
    shift,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders    
FROM hourly_sale 
GROUP BY shift
ORDER BY 
    CASE shift
        WHEN 'Morning' THEN 1
        WHEN 'Afternoon' THEN 2
        WHEN 'Evening' THEN 3
    END;
